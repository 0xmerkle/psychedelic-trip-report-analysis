# Psychedelic Experience Analysis Project

This project aims to scrape and analyze psychedelic experience reports from Erowid.org. Utilizing a combination of web scraping techniques and Large Language Model (LLM) analysis, we extract themes and insights from individual reports to generate a comprehensive understanding of various substances and their effects.

## Acknowledgments and Credits

- Thank you to [Erowid.org](https://erowid.org/) for maintaining a comprehensive database of experience reports.

- The `Erowid.ipynb` notebook used as a part of the scraping process in this project was originally found in the [psychedelic-data-science](https://github.com/basnijholt/psychedelic-data-science) repository created by Bas Nijholt.
  I have utilized and modified the code within this notebook to fit the specific needs of my project.

## Disclaimer

This is an ongoing research project and is subjetc to change. There may be some parts that do not work at times too. I would be more formal about the branching but seeing as I just started this, I'd prefer to move faster.
